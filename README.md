The article that I have chosen is ***Video Game Developers Are Leaving The Industry And Doing Something, Anything Else***. I chose this article because the video game industry is one that I am interested and want to work in. However, when I constantly see the news reporting employees being laid off and how the industry, in some ways, is suffering, I become more unsure and hesitant. I also think that reading the experiences of other people in the industry and how they ultimately decided to leave not just the video game industry, but the tech industry as a whole could help me gain a better perspective of what the environment is like.
